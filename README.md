# CPP Modules - 42 School

This repository contains a collection of C++ programming modules from 42 School's curriculum.

## Overview

The CPP modules are designed to introduce fundamental and advanced concepts of C++ programming, covering topics such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Memory management
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Templates and STL
- Exception handling
- Operator overloading

## Structure

Each module (CPP-00 through CPP-09) contains multiple exercises (ex00, ex01, etc.) that progressively build upon previous concepts.

```
CPP-00/  # Introduction to C++
CPP-01/  # Memory allocation, references, pointers
CPP-02/  # Ad-hoc polymorphism, operators overload
CPP-03/  # Inheritance
CPP-04/  # Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces
CPP-05/  # Exceptions
CPP-06/  # C++ casts
CPP-07/  # C++ templates
CPP-08/  # Templated containers, iterators, algorithms
CPP-09/  # STL
```

## Compilation

Each exercise includes a Makefile for compilation. To compile an exercise:

```bash
cd CPP-XX/exXX
make
```

## Usage

Run the compiled programs to test the implementations:

```bash
./program_name
```

## 42 School

This project is part of the 42 School curriculum, focusing on mastering C++ programming concepts through hands-on exercises and projects.
